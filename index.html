                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <p class="detail-description">Widowed Madan Chopra lives a very wealthy lifestyle with two daughters, Seema and Priya. His passion is car racing, and realizing that he is not young anymore, has his last race and wins - only to find out that another competitor, Vicky Malhotra, let him win. Madan befriends Vicky, introduces him to Priya and invites him to work for him in Bombay. Vicky and Priya are attracted to each other, much to Madan's delight and he announces their marriage. Before that could happen, Seema kills herself by throwing herself down from the roof of a multi-storied building. While Madan wants to close this case due to embarrassment, Seema meets with her college friend, Police Inspector Karan, and together they begin to unravel a plot that may well end Madan and the lives of others as well.
